# OpenAI API Python Guide

This Python script is from a YouTube tutorial on [Brutfab](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWLswLLUlVqWfVg8lLY5S9Q)'s channel, focusing on beginners using the OpenAI API.

There are 2 different methods you can use to access the OpenAI API, the first method is to use the OpenAI python library, in which I provided the examples in the pt1 directory
the second method is to access through the direct http request. You can check out the example in the pt2 directory.

## Pt. 1 Steps

1. **Setup**: Initializes OpenAI API using the API key loaded from a `.env` file.

2. **Models**: Uses `openai.Model.list()` to list all available models for the given API key.

3. **API Usage**: Provides examples of how to use the API, including an interactive chat with the GPT-3.5-turbo model and an illustration of the 'temperature' parameter's effect.

## Pt. 2 Steps

1. **Setup**: Initializes OpenAI API using the API key loaded from a `.env` file.

2. **Post Request**: Make your first post request

3. **Util Function** Build a utility function

## Usage

change the `.env.template` file to `.env` and put your openai api key
